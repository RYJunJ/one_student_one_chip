# One Student One Chip 一生一芯
## About the Project
Launched by Professor Yungang Bao from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)

This open custom project instructs students to build their own RISC-V system, including application, OS, processor and SoC. The project will also guide students to conduct physical design for the RISC-V chips and then tape out.
